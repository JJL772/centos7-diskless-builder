Overview
========
The KMOD RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a precompiled binary for Red Hat* 
Enterprise Linux* (RHEL), using Red Hat's KMOD RPM format specification.

The KMOD RPMs update existing RPMs currently installed on the system. These 
updates are provided by Red Hat in the RHEL release.

One KMOD RPM file is available for each supported version of RHEL. You must 
match the KMOD RPM to the version of RHEL on the target system.

NOTE: If the RHEL operating system does not display the correct branding strings,
download the latest pci.ids file from https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/ to the
/usr/share/hwdata/ directory.


Install Using KMOD RPM
======================
KMOD RPMs are provided for supported Linux* distributions. The naming 
convention for the included RPMs is:

  kmod-<driver name>-<driver version>-<rpm rel>.<arch type>.rpm

For example, kmod-ixgbe-5.9.4-201130.x86_64.rpm:

  - ixgbe is the driver name;
  - 5.9.4 is the version;
  - 201130 is the RPM release version;
  - x86_64 is the architecture type.

Do the following to install the KMOD RPM. NOTE: You must be logged in as root 
to install the driver.

1. Download the KMOD RPM file to your system.

2. Install the KMOD RPM using the rpm command: 

  # rpm -i <rpm filename>

  For example:

  # rpm -i kmod-ixgbe-5.9.4-201130.x86_64.rpm 

3. Check the status of the new installed driver. For example:

  # modinfo ixgbe

4. Make the newly installed driver active in the running kernel. You can 
do this by rebooting the system or using the rmmod or modprobe commands. 
For example: 

  # shutdown -r now 

	or 

  # rmmod ixgbe; sleep 1; modprobe ixgbe
